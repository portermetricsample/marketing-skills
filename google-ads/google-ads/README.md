# Google Ads — use cases

Google Ads reports built with [SUMAS](../_framework/sumas.md) on the
Porter Metrics MCP (`google-ads` connector).

## Strategy context (the "S" in SUMAS, shared across all cases)

- **Porter connector:** `google-ads`.
- **Account format:** `<customer_id>-<login_customer_id>` (two 10-digit IDs
  joined by a hyphen). Never make up the ID — discover it with `list_accounts`.
- **Before any report:** get the campaign type *fingerprint*
  (`google_ads_campaign_advertising_channel_type`): Search, Performance Max,
  Shopping, Demand Gen, Display, Video, App. What you can report changes with
  the type (e.g. PMax does not expose keywords).
